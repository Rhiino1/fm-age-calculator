## My process

Sames as always, mobile first workflow, some react, some tailwind. I hate doing validation from scratch, I know there is some React-form validation but I wanted to do it by myself.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS library

### What I learned

Validation form sucks.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwindcss Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - There is all the information and knowledge you need to start learning Tailwindcss. -[React-hook-form, tailwindcss and Yup for form input validation](https://www.uchaudhary.com.np/blog/react-form-with-react-hook-form-yup-and-tailwindcss) - There is a simple way to validate inputs with React and Tailwind.
